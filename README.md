git clone https://github.com/hackergarage/osomtalk.git
cd osomtalk
npm install

cd public/js
cp public/js/frontend_config.js.tmpl public/js/frontend_config.js

Edit ```app_config.js``` and ```public/jsfrontend_config.js``` with your own settings (most probably localhost in port 3000) and then:

```
node app.js
```

Then you can go to http://localhost:3000/ and start playing with **OsomTalk**
